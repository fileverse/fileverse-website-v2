### About Fileverse
In an era where online collaboration is mostly dictated by monopolistic platforms compromising both privacy and creativity, Fileverse focuses on the healthier side of the internet where users are not the product. 

The dApp offers a suite of tools similar to Google Workspace and Notion but with the difference that it enhances your privacy, independence, and creativity. Onchain is the new Online so it's time for a new type of collaboration!

Create your own ideal space for everyday online/onchain activities: 
- peer-to-peer file-sharing and cheap file storage via IPFS & Arweave
- writing a document with multiple people 
- publishing a decentralised website, blog or a portfolio
- brainstorming ideas on a whiteboard with collaborators 
- creating an onchain community or team that share access to all of the above 
- Trustless co-management of collaboration spaces, digital gardens, & knowledge bases via Safe Multisigs

Fileverse also released the [HeartBit SDK](https://fileverse.io/heartbit): provable, time-based onchain "Likes" that people generate by simply engaging with your app, website, onchain media, Frame or OpenAction for Farcaster and Lens protocols!
